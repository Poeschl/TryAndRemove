Try and Remove
================
Record your app installations and remove them all or specific apps from inside the app in a very quick way.

Simple example:
Want to try out several apps of the same type and keep only one of them after testing. So instead of remove them one by one, you can remove them from your device like a bash uninstall.

Features
--------

+ Toggle the record of app installations.
+ Remove all recorded apps like a batch uninstall.
+ Remove just specific apps or exclude some from the uninstall process.
+ Made with material design

Permissions
------------
Network - For displaying some nearly invisible ads.

Note
-----
This is in the main a private project to learn something more about some libraries and help me do my daily android development. So it will only be updated in my free time and I can't promise you a fast progress.
