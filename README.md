Debug and Delete
================

This is the repository of my little android app which should help developers to remove a bunch of apps at once from the phone.
You saw there are already apps for that? Agreed, but do they gives you the opportunity to record all apps installations during your testing and developing and uninstall these only?

This is a in the main a private project to learn something more about some libraries and help me do my daily android development. So it will only be updated in my free time and I can't promise you a fast progress.

Since the first version of it is release, I will also enable the bug tracker.
