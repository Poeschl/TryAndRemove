Try and Remove
================

This app allows you to record app installations on your phone and remove them afterwards all together with almost one (three) clicks.

A example situation for the app is a sample of my development work. I install during a workday a few apps on my private phone and at the end of the day I want to get rid of them.
So this app helps me really out.

The app allows you to enable or disable the recording of your app installs / removals. Of course you can remove all apps in the list via the button on the bottom right corner.

To use this app you need to have Android 4.0.3 +. To get your hands on a pre-compiled version, you can download it in the download section of this repository.

If you have any bugs or improvements, it would be nice to add an entry in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Poeschl/TryAndRemove/issues).

Note
======

This is in the main a private project to learn something more about some libraries and help me do my daily android development. So it will only be updated in my free time and I can't promise you a fast progress.
