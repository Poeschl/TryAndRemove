Record your app installations and remove them all or specific apps from inside the app in a very quick way.

Simple example:
Want to try out several apps of the same type and keep only one of them after testing. So instead of remove them one by one, you can remove them from your device like a bash uninstall.

<b>Features:</b>

&#8226;&#8195; Toggle the record of app installations.
&#8226;&#8195; Remove all recorded apps like a batch uninstall.
&#8226;&#8195; Remove just specific apps or exclude some from the uninstall process.
&#8226;&#8195; Made with material design
