<h1>PRIVACY POLICY - Try and Remove</h1>

<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application
    Try and Remove (&#x201c;Application&#x201d;) for mobile devices that was created by
    Markus P&ouml;schl. The Application is giving you the opportunity to record
    app installations on your phone and remove them afterwards all
    together with a few clicks.</p>

<h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it
    used?</h2>

<h3>User Provided Information</h3>

    download the application from Google Play or and alternative
    deployment platform.</p>

</p>

<h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information
    obtained by the Application?</h2>

<p>Yes. I will share your information with third parties only in
    the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>

<p>I may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected
    Information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or
        similar legal process;
    </li>
    <li>when I believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
        protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,

        do not have an independent use of the information I disclose to them,
        and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy
        statement.

        analytics companies as described in the section below.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Automatic Data Collection and Advertising</h3>

<p>I may work with analytics companies to help me understand how
    the Application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of
    usage. I work with advertisers and third party advertising networks,
    who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the
    Application which helps us keep the cost of the Application free.
    Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information
    collected by the Application, including, but not limited to, the
    unique identification ID of your mobile device and your mobile
    telephone number. These third parties may also obtain anonymous
    information about other applications you&#x2019;ve downloaded to your mobile
    device, the mobile websites you visit, your non-precise location
    information (e.g., your zip code), and other non- precise location
    information in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted
    advertising on the Application and elsewhere.</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;d like to optout from third party use of this type of
    information to help serve targeted advertising, please read the
    section entitled &#x201c;Opt-out&#x201d; below.</p>

<p>For the used third party companies and/or frameworks please the
    the specific section.</p>

<h3>Collected Analytics Data</h3>

<p>
    The Application uses the crashlytics framework to track frequent crashes and
    development errors. So the Application may collect certain information
    automatically, including, but not limited to, the device's operating
    system name, operating system version, Android ID and Android
    Advertising ID. For more information which data crashlytics collects
    please go to the <a href="http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/">crashlytics
    privacy policy</a>.

<p>The collection of data through crashlytics can be opted out like
    described in the &#x201c;Opt-out&#x201d; below.</p>

<!-- <h3>Collected Advertising Data</h3>

    The advertising is done through mopub. To work properly this framework
    may collect certain information automatically, including, but not
    limited to, the device's operating system name, carrier name and
    Information about advertisements served, viewed, or clicked on. To get an overview
    which data is collected and how it is used, please go to the <a
